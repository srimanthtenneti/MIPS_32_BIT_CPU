### Introduction
#### History <a name="mips_his"></a>

![MIPS_LOGO](Images/mips_logo_678x452.png)

MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) is a family of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architectures developed by MIPS Computer Systems, now MIPS Technologies, based in the United States.

There are multiple versions of MIPS: including MIPS I, II, III, IV, and V; as well as five releases of MIPS32/64 (for 32- and 64-bit implementations, respectively). The early MIPS architectures were 32-bit; 64-bit versions were developed later. As of April 2017, the current version of MIPS is MIPS32/64 Release 6. MIPS32/64 primarily differs from MIPS Iâ€“V by defining the privileged kernel mode System Control Coprocessor in addition to the user mode architecture.

#### Targeted ISA <a name="ISA"></a>
